A modest amount of preparation is required before running the maven
test target.

1. A database must be created with the pl/java extension present. The 
   database connection information is present in 
   src/test/resources/database.properties.

2. The test user must be a 'superuser' in order to load and unload
   pl/java jar files.

3. The jar file must be built first with 'mvn jar:jar' and copied to
   the project directory as 'userdefinedtypes.jar'.

The XDatabaseTest will handle creating a schema, loading the appropriate
jar file (see #3), running the unit tests, and then unloading the jar
file and dropping the schema.

If things go toes up it may be necessary to clear the database manually.

  $ psql javatest
  javatest=# select sqlj.remove_jar('invariantproperties', true);
  javatest=# drop schema invariantproperties;
  
If you drop the schema before you remove the jar file you will probably
need to recreate the database.
